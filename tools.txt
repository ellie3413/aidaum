Free AI tools
If you're looking for free AI tools, you're in luck! I made sure that every AI tool listed in this article offers either a free plan or free trial with no credit card required, allowing you to explore their features and functionality without any commitment.
The best AI assistants (chatbots)
1. ChatGPT
PlayStart using ChatGPT Instantly
ChatGPT consistently ranks at the top of the LM Arena leaderboard, outperforming other models in key benchmarks. It's the world's most popular AI application, with 200 million users as of October 2024.
I’ve used ChatGPT extensively for brainstorming ideas, translation tasks, coding, AI script generation, data analysis and managing research-heavy tasks. The new 4o model is a significant leap forward—it’s incredibly fast, and feels way smarter than any of the previous versions of ChatGPT.
With ChatGPT's multimodal capabilities I can paste in images—like a chart or graph—and ask questions about it, making it much easier to interpret visual data quickly. I fed it a PNG image of a chart and it analysed the chart, gave me a table of the raw data (that it read from the chart image) and then re-did the chart in my preferred colors - pretty impressive.
ChatGPT can now retain context over time, personalizing responses based on previous conversations. For instance, I’ve used it to refine recurring project ideas without re-explaining every detail, saving hours of effort. You can review and manage what it remembers through OpenAI’s controls, to make sure it doesn't go all Skynet on you.
The integrated ChatGPT search option (more on this later) makes it even easier to find relevant information directly within conversations, which cuts down on the hallucinations with the use of RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation). RAG grounds the AI's answer by retrieving information from external data sources.
While it excels in creative and general-purpose tasks, I’d recommend exploring other tools like Claude (see below) for coding. It's not that ChatGPT is bad at coding tasks, it's just that Claude is great at them.
ChatGPT o1
o1 is a specialized advanced reasoning model built for complex problem-solving, coding, and math.
While I find 4o excels in creativity and versatility, o1 has proven incredibly useful for specific tasks like coding, troubleshooting technical issues, and even solving intricate math problems that other models struggled with. I’ve used it to generate shell scripts, work through spreadsheet problems, and even tackle cryptic crossword puzzles, where its precision and logical depth really shine.
However, it lacks the broader capabilities and tool integrations of 4o, so I see it more as a complementary option for specific needs rather than a full replacement for more creative or expansive tasks.
Operators
In January 2025, ChatGPT introduced "Operators," AI agents that can book hotels, order food, and shop online. Exclusive to Pro users ($200/month), they show exciting potential but are hit-or-miss in execution.
For instance, I asked the Operator to book a hotel in NYC. It started strong, navigating filters and searching TripAdvisor, but eventually got stuck in a loop. Ordering a pizza was similar—it customized the order but couldn’t complete checkout. Shopping worked better; it found a laptop under $1,000 on Amazon but required me to finish the purchase manually. Operators let you take control when they get stuck, but the laggy browser often makes doing it yourself easier.
Right now, Operators feel more like a proof-of-concept than a practical tool. While the idea of automating repetitive tasks is exciting, it needs improvements in speed and reliability. If you’re already a Pro user, it’s worth exploring, but not essential yet.
Pricing
OpenAI offer a free tier which currently gives you limited access to GPT-4o and unlimited access to ChatGPT-4o mini. The Plus plan gets you wider access and costs $20/month - I think that's pretty good value for money. They also offer a Pro plan for $200/month which gives you priority access to their latest tools.


2. Claude
PlayClaude 3.5 Sonnet for sparking creativity
I’ve been using Claude (their Sonnet 3.5 model to be specific), for coding tasks, and it’s quickly becoming my go-to for code reviews. What really makes Claude stand out is how precise it is—it seems to "get" the nuances of programming better than other tools I’ve tried. I’ve used it to spot subtle issues in my code and even brainstorm better ways to structure projects. Anthropic are training these models on more recent and specialized coding knowledge and it shows, especially when tackling modern frameworks or troubleshooting tricky bugs.
Another thing I love about Claude is how nice it is to talk to. It feels like it has more "soul" compared to ChatGPT—the tone is warmer, and conversations just flow better. Whether I’m bouncing around ideas or working through a complicated issue, it’s genuinely pleasant to interact with. I have quite reached Her levels of affection for Claude, but we're getting there.
That said, I have hit the response and rate limits a little faster than I’d like, which can be a hassle if I’m deep into a project. But for $20/month on the Pro plan, it’s still a great deal, especially if you’re looking for an AI assistant that’s smart, approachable, and particularly strong in coding tasks.
3. Gemini
PlayGoogle – Welcome to the Gemini era
Google’s Gemini fits seamlessly into the Google ecosystem. On Android, it feels like a natural extension of the system rather than a separate app, and if you’re already using Google Workspace, it’s incredibly convenient. Whether I was drafting emails, summarizing articles, or asking it random questions, it delivered quickly and smoothly.
I’ve found it useful in unexpected ways too. When reviewing legal documents, I’d do my initial read-through and then ask Gemini to double-check if I missed anything. Another time, I struggled with a confusing sizing chart while shopping for clothes. I snapped a picture of the label, described my usual size, and let Gemini handle the rest. The suggestion was spot-on, and I ended up with a perfect fit!
For creative projects, Gemini’s image capabilities really shine. I once uploaded an image I liked and asked it to describe it as a prompt for an AI image generator. The results were creative and inspiring, making it a fun tool for brainstorming new ideas.
When I was working on a project proposal, Gemini Advanced provided nuanced, tailored suggestions that felt like a genuine productivity boost. It even made copywriting easier—generating meaningful text for design mockups that felt polished, rather than using generic filler like "Lorem Ipsum."
However, it’s not perfect. One frustration I had was with its context retention. When revising a piece of writing, I had to re-explain instructions a few times because it would forget what we’d already discussed. Similarly, when I uploaded an Excel file, got a summary, and later updated the data, Gemini treated the updated file as a brand-new task instead of building on what we’d already done.
Another weak spot is its performance on technical tasks. While it’s great at formatting and debugging simple code, I found that it sometimes rewrote JavaScript as Python unnecessarily. For more specialized or dense content, like legal texts, its analysis lacked depth compared to what I was hoping for. Even its responses to some image-based queries were occasionally inaccurate, which was a letdown after seeing its creative potential elsewhere.
That said, Gemini’s strengths outweigh its flaws. Its tight integration with Google tools makes it practical for anyone already in the Google ecosystem, and its ability to handle both text and images makes it a versatile tool for creative projects. While it’s not the best choice for highly technical or niche tasks, it’s a solid, fast, and easy-to-use assistant for everyday needs—and for me, the advanced features have made it a tool I’ve come to rely on.
While the free Basic version (using the 1.5 Flash model) covers most casual needs, the $19.99/month Gemini Advanced adds the more powerful 1.5 Pro and Gemini-Exp-1206 models for complex tasks like coding, math, and deep research, including analyzing texts up to 1,500 pages.
4. DeepSeek
DeepSeek is also worth checking out. They let you use their V3 and new R1 models for free on their site, although you still have to pay for API access (it's very cheap though).
DeepSeek's search feels more engaging and "sticky" even after just a few queries. Its transparency—showing reasoning and openly acknowledging what it knows and what it might not—builds a significant level of user trust.
In January 2025, they launched their R1 model as a competitor to ChatGPT's o1, quickly gaining attention in the AI community for being both cost-effective and open source. I've played around with both their R1 and V3 models.
I asked both ChatGPT-o1 and DeepSeek-R1 to analyze sections of a presentation I’m working on. R1 provided a more comprehensive analysis, addressing key aspects that o1 overlooked. I also had both brainstorm ideas, and once again, R1 delivered significantly better suggestions than o1.
For coding I’ve been relying more on DeepSeek (v3) lately because of its straightforward approach—it gets straight to the point with its suggestions. Claude (3.5 Sonnet), by contrast, often takes a more detailed route, proposing multiple solutions and leaning toward the one that aligns best with solid software engineering practices. Both tools are excellent in their own ways, and I’ve started using them equally. DeepSeek is great for its affordability and efficiency, while Claude is invaluable for double-checking critical code and ensuring everything is on point. Together, they make a great team.
For writing, I'm less keen on these DeepSeek models. I find its output less natural-sounding and oftentimes boring and repetitive.
5. Grok
Grok 3 is a capable model that handles most tasks well, but in my experience, it doesn’t feel significantly different from other top-tier LLMs.
I tested it for brainstorming, coding assistance, and extended conversations, and while it performed reliably, nothing about it truly stood out.
It does a decent job at keeping context and generating detailed responses, but when I compared it to ChatGPT and Claude, I found its coding suggestions to be hit-or-miss. Some solutions were spot on, while others required heavy corrections, which isn’t uncommon with AI coding assistants, but it didn’t seem to have the same level of consistency as the best models out there.
What does makes Grok 3 unique is its direct access to real-time Twitter data, which could give it an advantage for up-to-date information, but I didn’t find it noticeably better at current events than other AI models.
It also has far fewer content restrictions, meaning it’s more open to generating responses that other LLMs outright refuse. While that might appeal to some users, it also raises concerns, especially when it comes to generating highly offensive or legally questionable content.
And then there’s the cost. Unlike other free-tier AI models, accessing Grok 3 requires an X Premium+ subscription at $40/month, which makes it one of the more expensive options.
While it’s solid and functional, I didn’t walk away feeling like it was a must-have over existing models, especially considering the price barrier.
The best AI video generators
6. Synthesia
PlayCreate an AI Video in 4 Minutes with Synthesia 
Synthesia is the leading AI video generator which allows you to generate realistic AI human avatar videos. I’ve used it for creating training modules and presentations, and it’s clear why it’s a favorite for learning and development teams. By turning text into video, Synthesia simplifies the production of high-quality content without the need for cameras, microphones, or studios.
Its most popular use case is undoubtedly training videos, but Synthesia is versatile enough to handle a wide range of needs. Businesses use it for internal communications, onboarding new employees, and creating customer support or knowledge base videos. On the marketing side, it excels in producing personalized sales outreach videos, B2B marketing content, explainer videos and even product demos. I’ve personally also found it handy for website videos that needed a polished, professional touch with minimal effort.
Two things I love about Synthesia are the ability to customize avatars and the wide variety of templates offered. When I needed to create tailored training videos for different departments, Synthesia made it easy to switch the avatar language, tone, or background to suit the audience. The library of over 230 digital avatars and support for 140+ languages means you can create globally consistent content effortlessly.
While Synthesia shines for corporate-style videos, it’s not designed for storytelling or cinematic visuals. It’s best for teams and businesses that prioritize speed, professionalism, and brand consistency in their video production workflows.
Synthesia offers a free plan that allows users to generate up to 36 minutes of video per year, with no credit card required. For more extensive features, paid plans start at $29 per month.
7. Runway
PlayGen-3 Alpha: Available Now | Runway
Runway is a powerful AI video creation platform packed with features like text-to-video, image-to-video, Motion Brush, Camera Controls, and Inpainting. I’ve mostly used it to convert text into AI video for social media posts.
Tools like Motion Brush make it easy to add animations to specific parts of a video, while Camera Controls let you adjust angles and focus for a cinematic feel. The Inpainting feature is particularly impressive, allowing me to seamlessly remove or alter elements in a scene without disrupting the video’s continuity—tasks that usually require advanced skills and fancy video editing software. There is still a bit of a learning curve though, especially for newcomers to video editing.
Runway’s pricing is flexible: the Standard Plan ($12/month) is great for light use, the Pro Plan ($28/month) offers more credits and features, and the Unlimited Plan ($144/month) is ideal for high-output creators or teams. Runway also offers the Basic plan. This plan provides individuals with 125 one-time credits for free. A very light version of Runway is also integrated into Canva so you can try it out there too.
Runway shines for creatives like filmmakers, digital artists, and content creators looking to push boundaries. Though rendering times can occasionally lag for high-resolution videos, the results are worth it. For me, it’s become an essential tool for experimenting and achieving professional-quality outputs, whether for short-form content or storytelling projects.
8. Filmora
PlayFilmora 14 is HERE! | Introducing a NEW way to edit
Filmora immediately stood out to me as one of the most user-friendly video editors I’ve tried. Its drag-and-drop functionality and clean interface made it easy to start editing, even without much prior experience. The platform also offers a wide variety of transitions, effects, and templates, which made creating polished videos for YouTube and social media a breeze.
What really sets Filmora apart is its impressive range of AI-powered tools. The AI Smart Cutout feature makes isolating objects as easy as painting over them, while the AI Remove Background tool lets you swap out video backgrounds without needing a green screen. I particularly loved the AI Audio Denoise and Silence Detection tools, which helped clean up audio and remove unnecessary pauses to create smoother edits.
The AI Motion Tracking feature added a fun, creative element to my projects, allowing me to track moving objects for privacy blurring or quirky effects like adding stickers. The AI Audio Stretch tool also came in handy, saving me time by extending background music to perfectly fit scene transitions.
While Filmora’s AI tools are convenient and time-saving, they’re not flawless. Features like Smart Cutout and Remove Background sometimes require manual touch-ups, especially for complex scenes. Additionally, rendering can slow down when working with high-resolution files or heavy AI usage, which might be a concern for professional-grade projects.
Overall, Filmora is an excellent choice for creators looking for an affordable, AI-enhanced video editor that simplifies the editing process without sacrificing quality. Whether you’re a hobbyist or a social media creator, it’s a well-rounded option that makes video editing both fun and highly efficient.
Filmora plans start at $49.99 per year or a lifetime license for $79.99. While the free version is handy for testing, it does come with a watermark on exports.
9. OpusClip
PlayClipAnything: First-ever multimodal AI clipping that allows you to clip any video
OpusClip is a great tool for breaking down longer videos into short, shareable clips for social media. It’s straightforward to use and does a lot of the heavy lifting for you.
The AI feature is surprisingly effective at finding the best parts of a video, so I didn’t have to spend ages scrubbing through footage. It also resized my clips automatically to fit platforms like TikTok and Instagram.
Adding captions is quick and simple, and the option to throw in emojis makes the clips feel more dynamic—especially useful for grabbing attention in silent scrolling. I also really liked the “hook” feature that picks out key moments to start the clip off strong.
Opus Clip makes it easy to create eye-catching content from videos I’ve already made. It’s practical, efficient, and takes some of the hassle out of social media editing.
The best AI image generators
10. GPT-4o
PlayCharacter Consistency with 4o Image Generation
The new GPT-4o image generator is seriously impressive. The jump in quality (vs. the previous DALL·E 3 image generation model) is obvious right away. It handles people so much better than before. Faces look realistic, proportions make sense, and even details like posture and lighting often feel intentional. It’s not just spitting out random visual noise anymore. It actually looks like it knows what it's doing.
One thing that really stood out is how well it generates text. I asked for posters, signs, even labeled diagrams, and most of the time the writing was perfectly readable. That alone makes it way more useful than older versions. It also does a much better job with character consistency, which is something other tools like Midjourney still struggle with.
That said, it’s not flawless. It still struggles with certain prompts, especially fantasy-related ones like maps or magical creatures. Some filters are still pretty strict. Also, the rollout is kind of all over the place. I got it on my phone but not on desktop at first. But when it works, it’s genuinely exciting. I’ve already started using it for mockups and visuals I used to need Photoshop for.
11. Midjourney
Midjourney remains my favorite AI image generator for painterly and imaginative visuals. Its artistic strength lies in its ability to create stunning fantasy and sci-fi imagery or richly textured "historical" photos.
One area where Midjourney shines is in its painterly aesthetic, particularly for faces and intricate details in surreal contexts. I’ve noticed it struggles with rendering faces at a distance, but for speculative and narrative-driven artwork—like a dreamy space opera or a mythical kingdom—Midjourney is unmatched.
For grounded realism, I rely on DALL-E 3, but when crafting vibrant, otherworldly scenes or highly conceptual art, Midjourney is my go-to tool.
Like DALL-E 3, it lacks the ability to define reusable characters or objects, a feature that would massively enhance its value for consistent visual storytelling.
Midjourney offers both free and premium plans. The free plan allows users to create a small number of images, while the premium plans offers more generations, faster processing, and access to additional tools. The cheapest premium option is the basic plan which cost me $10/month.
The best AI meeting assistants
12. Fathom
Fathom AI Notetaker is the best AI meeting recorder I’ve used. It records meetings seamlessly, generates clear and structured summaries, and provides a full transcript that I can search using AI-powered questions with timestamps for the answers. I save hours each week by not having to rewatch recordings or take notes manually. The summaries are so accurate that they require little to no editing.
The app is free to use with some limitations. Premium plans start at $19 per month and unlock unlimited AI features along with more integration options. For the price, it is hard to beat, especially with how well it captures questions and action items.
Fathom joins meetings reliably and gives me the option to opt out when needed. It even notifies me when I have been talking too long, which is something I never knew I needed but now really appreciate. It's great for client calls, making follow-ups and task tracking effortless. At this point, I cannot imagine handling meetings without it.
13. Nyota
Nyota is another AI-powered meeting assistant designed to enhance productivity by automating note-taking, task management, and meeting planning.
I connected Nyota to our calendar and it automatically joined scheduled meetings. During meetings, Nyota captured key points, decisions, and action items, allowing me to stay fully engaged in the discussion without the distraction of manual note-taking. 
Post-meeting, Nyota provided detailed transcripts and concise summaries, highlighting essential information and assigned tasks. This feature was particularly beneficial for team members who couldn't attend, as they could quickly catch up on critical discussions. 
Nyota's has some cool meeting planning capabilities. It offered AI-generated suggestions for relevant topics, ensuring our meetings were focused and productive. Additionally, Nyota integrated with our project management tools, automatically creating tasks and updates based on meeting discussions.
While Nyota's features were comprehensive, I found that it had a similar issue as tl;dv in that its editing capabilities for transcripts were somewhat limited. Additionally, while Nyota excelled in capturing meeting content, it didn't offer the same depth in post-meeting analytics as some other tools. These analytics typically measure aspects of the meeting, for example if everyone got a chance to speak, which sounds weird but can really help get everyone contributing to the discussion in an unbiased way.
In comparison to tl;dv, another AI meeting assistant, Nyota provided a more holistic approach by integrating meeting notes with project management tools. While tl;dv focused on transcription and summarization, Nyota's strength lay in its ability to connect meeting insights directly to project tasks and planning.
Nyota offers a Starter Plan at $12/month with basic features like meeting note-taking. There's a 7-day free trial.
The best AI research tools
14. Deep research
PlayOpenAI deep research in practice.
OpenAI's deep research will find, analyze & synthesize hundreds of online sources to create a comprehensive report minutes.
I’ve tested it across multiple domains, and the speed and depth of its insights are unreal—what would normally take me hours, if not days, is now condensed into minutes.
The tool doesn’t just regurgitate facts; it actually synthesizes information in a way that feels like having a top-tier research assistant. Whether it’s legal analysis, investment reports, or technical breakdowns, it compiles sources, structures findings, and presents a level of clarity that’s hard to match.
The citation system is solid, though I’ve noticed that in highly specialized fields, it can occasionally misinterpret details, meaning a final manual check is still necessary.
That said, I don’t think its limitations take away from how powerful it is. It’s especially strong at identifying patterns and connections that might otherwise go unnoticed, making it feel like a true step toward AI-assisted research rather than just an advanced search engine.
Some might argue it’s not "creating" new information, but in practice, the way it organizes and presents data often leads to insights I wouldn’t have reached on my own.
There’s no doubt that tools like this are shifting the way research is done, and while it’s not perfect, it’s the closest thing I’ve seen to an AI that genuinely enhances intellectual work rather than just speeding it up.
The best AI writing tools
15. Rytr
I’ve used Rytr as an AI writing assistant for generating quick, polished content, and it’s a great alternative when you want something simple and efficient. It’s particularly effective for short-form writing tasks like social media posts, product descriptions, or email drafts. One thing that stands out is its collection of over 40 pre-designed templates, which help structure your content right from the start, saving time when you’re stuck on how to begin.
Compared to ChatGPT, Rytr feels more focused and specialized for writing tasks. While ChatGPT is great for brainstorming and exploring ideas, Rytr is better when you need a ready-to-go format or a professional tone without much back-and-forth. It also comes with a built-in plagiarism checker, giving you peace of mind about originality, and supports over 30 languages, making it ideal for multilingual content creation.
I’ve noticed, however, that Rytr struggles a bit with longer or more complex writing, so it’s not my first choice for in-depth articles. That said, for short-form content, it’s fast, effective, and affordable, with plans starting at just $9/month. If you’re a freelancer, small business owner, or marketer looking for a streamlined tool that gets the job done, Rytr is a solid pick.
16. Sudowrite
PlayWhat does Sudowrite do? AI writing features explained
I'm an aspiring novelist in my spare time, so I snuck this one into the list.
I’ve been using Sudowrite as a creative writing assistant, and it’s an excellent tool for anyone working on fiction. It’s ideal for overcoming writer’s block, generating fresh ideas, and crafting more vivid narratives. Features like the ‘Describe’ tool, which helps create immersive descriptions, and ‘Brainstorm,’ which sparks creative plot points, have significantly improved my storytelling process. The ‘Expand’ feature is also useful for turning rough outlines into fully developed drafts.
Unlike ChatGPT or Rytr, Sudowrite isn’t designed for creating emails, product descriptions, or blog posts. Its focus is entirely on fiction—helping you write better dialogue, build richer characters, and refine your narrative structure. For instance, when I was stuck on a scene, Sudowrite provided thoughtful suggestions to enhance the pacing and tension. It's the ultimate weapon against writers block - even if you don't end up using what it comes up with, it'll still get you thinking about the next sentence in a different way.
While it’s not suitable for business writing or technical content, it’s a fantastic choice for novelists, short story writers, or anyone experimenting with creative projects. With plans starting at $19/month, Sudowrite offers a unique way to elevate your fiction writing.

The best AI grammar checkers
17. Grammarly
I've been using Grammarly to enhance my writing for years, and now it has a bunch of AI-powered features. Beyond the usual catching grammar and spelling errors, Grammarly offers tone adjustments, strategic suggestions, and full-sentence rewrites.
Grammarly's new AI writing assistant generates content ideas and assists in drafting emails and documents, and is integrated directly into various platforms, including Gmail, Google Docs, and Microsoft Word, providing real-time suggestions as I write. These integrations have made it easier for me to maintain consistency and professionalism across the different writing tasks I'm faced with on a typical work day. 
While Grammarly excels in refining and enhancing existing text, it's not designed for generating long-form content from scratch. However, for editing and improving drafts, its AI features are must-have. There's a free version covering basic corrections and a premium plan starting at $30/month.
18. Wordtune
Another tool I've been using to refine my writing is Wordtune. Unlike Grammarly, which focuses primarily on grammar and spelling corrections, Wordtune excels in rephrasing sentences to improve clarity, tone, and style. 
One feature I find particularly useful is the ability to switch between formal and casual tones with a single click, allowing me to tailor my writing to different audiences effortlessly. Additionally, Wordtune offers advanced AI proofreading capabilities, ensuring that my spelling, grammar, and phrasing are all spot-on before I hit 'send'. 
Wordtune also provides contextual suggestions that complement my writing, creating content that perfectly matches my style, tone, and subject matter. This has been invaluable in maintaining consistency across all of my writing. 
While Wordtune is excellent for rewriting and enhancing existing text, it's not designed for generating long-form content from scratch. However, for editing and improving drafts, it provides some useful features that aren't quite covered by Grammarly. With a free version covering basic features and premium plans starting at $13.99/month, Wordtune offers a range of tools to elevate your writing.
The best AI search engines
19. Perplexity
PlayKnowledge On-Demand
Perplexity is more of a research engine than a search engine. Unlike traditional tools like Google, it doesn’t make you sift through a maze of links—instead, it provides direct answers with citations, making it far more efficient for knowledge work. That said, you still need to verify its responses, as some answers, particularly for technical queries, can rely on outdated information. I’ve seen it cite decade-old sources when I was testing it with some questions about CAD software, which wasn't great.
Where Perplexity truly stands out is its ability to surface results I wouldn’t have thought to search for. I use it to explore a topic from multiple angles, and its multi-step reasoning engine makes it ideal for in-depth research and synthesis. You can see it automatically detect when an extra search will lead to a better answer and then it starts working through each part of the query step-by-step.
For those looking for even more functionality, Perplexity Pro is worth checking out. The Pro version costs $20/month and offers faster responses and more detailed answers, significantly improving the overall experience.
The free version is great for casual use, but if you rely on Perplexity for heavy research, the Pro plan is a solid investment.
20. ChatGPT search
What I love about ChatGPT Search is how quick it is. It retrieves information at insane speed, while still offering deliberate reasoning when processing complex queries. This makes it incredibly effective for quickly answering questions or diving into more detailed topics without losing the conversational flow. That's the key point here - it feels like you're having a natural conversation with someone who knows everything.
There's also an option to ask for more details. Instead of just delivering a single response, ChatGPT Search acts like a guide, helping you explore a subject deeply, clarify concepts, and resolve any doubts. This interactive approach makes it ideal for tackling complex topics or learning in a more intuitive way.
That said, like all LLM-based search engines, it has its limitations. The Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) stage can sometimes produce subpar results, and the tool has a tendency to justify its search outcomes with certainty—even when they aren’t entirely accurate. For this reason, I always double-check important information.
ChatGPT Search is included with premium plans like ChatGPT Plus ($20/month), and it’s a valuable addition for those who need fast, flexible, and deeply interactive search capabilities. It also recently rolled out with limited capabilities for free users too.
The best AI for social media
21. Vista Social
I tried using Vista Social to manage our social media accounts, and it's quickly become an indispensable tool. Its comprehensive suite of features allows me to plan, collaborate, and schedule content across all my social channels seamlessly. The visual scheduling and preview capabilities are particularly helpful, enabling me to see exactly how my posts will appear before they go live.
The AI Assistant leverages ChatGPT to generate engaging captions and message replies and saves a bunch of time. Additionally, the platform's engagement tools consolidate all my social media messages, comments, and reviews in one place, making it easier to keep on top of things and build relationships with our audience. Vista Social also offers robust analytics and reporting tools, allowing me to measure the performance of my campaigns and adjust my strategy accordingly.
Vista Social is ideal for small to medium-sized businesses, marketing agencies, and individual content creators who need a comprehensive, affordable tool for managing social media. However, larger enterprises or teams with complex needs might find its features less robust compared to enterprise-level platforms, especially if they require advanced CRM integration or highly customized analytics.
With plans starting at $39/month, including planning and publishing tools, engagement features, AI assistance, and detailed reporting, Vista Social offers a lot of value for its price. It’s a user-friendly solution for anyone looking to simplify their social media management process.
22. FeedHive
PlayFeedHive - An AI-Driven Social Media Marketing Platform
I also loved FeedHive. Its AI-driven features, like content suggestions and hashtag recommendations, have been particularly useful for brainstorming posts when I’m short on ideas. Scheduling content is a breeze, and the visual previews help me make sure everything looks perfect before it goes live. I also appreciate how easy it is to adjust posts for different platforms within the same interface—it saves so much time.
The analytics dashboard is another highlight. I’ve used it to track follower activity and post performance, which has helped me identify what resonates most with my audience. FeedHive’s collaboration tools are handy too—I’ve been able to share drafts with my boss and get quick approvals without switching between apps.
That said, I’ve noticed its social listening capabilities are limited. If you’re looking to monitor brand mentions or trends in real time, you might find it lacking compared to other platforms. Vista Social offers more advanced engagement tools and social listening, though at a higher price point.
FeedHive is lightweight and affordable, starting at $19/month, which makes it a great fit for freelancers and small businesses. It’s been a reliable option for creating and scheduling content, especially if you want something simple yet effective.

23. Canva Magic Studio
PlayMeet Magic Studio | Let the power of AI supercharge your work
Canva has long been my go-to design tool (because it's so easy to use), and the addition of its AI-powered Magic Studio suite takes it to the next level with a variety of features that simplify and enhance the creative process. These features are:
• Magic Design: By inputting a prompt or uploading an image, Magic Design generates personalized templates for various formats like social media posts and presentations. This has been particularly useful when I'm short on inspiration, providing a solid starting point for my social media posts
• Magic Write: This tool assists in crafting content by generating text based on your prompts. I've found it helpful for drafting copy and sparking ideas when I have writers block
• Magic Edit: Magic Edit allows for seamless modifications within images, such as changing colors or removing elements. It's been invaluable for making quick adjustments without needing to switch to a separate (and more complicated) photo editing tool
• Magic Eraser: This feature enables the removal of unwanted objects from images. I've used it to clean up photos before I add them to a social media post
• Magic Animate: Magic Animate brings static designs to life by adding animations - great for creating engaging presentations and social media content that capture the attention
Regarding pricing, Canva offers a freemium model. You can try some Magic Studio tools for free, with certain limitations. For instance, Magic Write can be used up to 50 times in total for free. Upgrading to Canva Pro ($15/month) or Canva for Teams ($30/month for 3 seats) increases this limit to 250 times per person, per month. 
Magic Studio is ideal for individuals and teams looking to enhance their design capabilities without extensive experience. It's particularly beneficial for small businesses, marketers, and content creators who need to produce high-quality visuals.
24. Looka
Looka is an AI-powered logo design platform that makes branding simple and effective. I’ve used it for creating a logo for one of my side projects (an Airbnb property management company), and I was very pleased with the results. After entering my project name and choosing styles and colors, Looka generated several options that looked polished and professional. It’s incredibly user-friendly, even if you have zero design experience.
That's why I love Looka - the simplicity. Once I selected a design I liked, I could easily adjust the fonts, colors, and layouts to fine-tune the final result without feeling overwhelmed. The final logo looked so good that I downloaded the accompanying Brand Kit, which included matching social media templates and business card designs. Having everything ready-to-go saved me hours of extra work.
While Looka doesn’t offer the depth of customization you’d get with a professional designer, it’s perfect for small businesses or personal projects where time and cost are important. It’s simple, effective, and delivers great results that I’ve been really happy with.
Looka offers two primary pricing options:
• Logo-Only Packages: One-time purchases that include logo files in various formats. The Basic package is priced at $20, while the Premium package costs $65. 
• Brand Kit Subscriptions: Annual subscriptions providing access to a comprehensive brand kit with over 300 customizable assets. The standard Brand Kit is $96 per year, and the Brand Kit with an AI-generated website is $129 per year. 
The best AI app builders
25. Bolt
Getting a bit more technical now, but if I managed it then you can too! This tool blew me away.
Bolt.new is an AI-powered platform that allows you to quickly prototype, run, edit, and deploy full-stack applications directly from your browser. I decided to give it a try by building a simple web application for managing tasks.
Building an app on the platform was fast and intuitive. I typed a prompt describing the app—“Build a task manager with a to-do list, user authentication, and a simple dashboard”—and Bolt.new generated a working prototype. From there, I was able to refine the design and functionality using the built-in editor. I added a delete button to each task and adjusted the styling using the code editor and it all seemed to work fine.
What I found most impressive was that it can deploy the apps for you. Once I was happy with the app, I clicked “deploy,” and boom, the app was live. The platform handled everything—from hosting to managing serverless functions, it all saved me a ton of time compared to setting up everything manually in a local development environment. It's perfect for prototyping an app.
Bolt.new supports frameworks and libraries like React, Next.js, and Vite, so you can probably still use your preferred tech stack. The AI also helped with code generation and debugging to such an extent that I actually didn't use Claude while I was working on my mini-app.
Bolt.new isn't the best fit for complex projects that require extensive business logic or integration with third-party services. For more intricate systems or advanced features, you'll still need a real developer.
All in all, I found Bolt.new to be an excellent tool for quickly building and deploying web applications, especially for rapid prototypes or smaller projects. If you're looking to develop something fast and don't want to worry about managing the backend or hosting, it’s a fantastic option.
Bolt.new offers a free plan that provides a daily allocation of 100,000 tokens. The Pro Plan is available at $18 per month, offering 10 million tokens per month.
26. Bubble
If you don't want to do any coding at all, then Bubble might be a better option. Bubble is a no-code platform that empowers users to build fully functional web applications. To test it out, I tried using it to develop a custom project management tool.
The platform's drag-and-drop editor allowed me to design the user interface by placing elements like buttons, text fields, and images directly onto the canvas. I could define workflows to specify how the app should respond to user interactions, such as creating tasks or sending notifications. Bubble's built-in database management enabled me to set up data structures and relationships without needing to manage a separate database.
One feature I found particularly useful was the ability to integrate third-party APIs. For instance, I connected the app to a calendar service to synchronize deadlines, enhancing my tool's usefulness. Bubble also offers a plugin marketplace which really extends the platform's capabilities.
While Bubble is powerful, it does still have a learning curve. Understanding how to structure data and workflows effectively took some time. There's a good level of support available via the documentation and community forums, so if you're willing to put some effort in you'll definitely be able to get the results you want.
Bubble is an excellent choice for entrepreneurs and small businesses looking to create custom web applications without the need for extensive coding knowledge. I think it's pretty amazing that you can build such a wide range of applications without writing any code whatsoever.
Bubble is tailored for users seeking a no-code solution with a focus on visual design and workflow management, whereas Bolt.new leverages AI to provide a more hands-on development experience with full-stack capabilities directly in the browser.
Bubble offers a Free Plan that allows users to build and prototype applications without any cost. Their Personal Plan is priced at $32 per month.
27. Lovable
PlayPresenting Lovable - The world’s first AI Fullstack Engineer
Lovable is another no-code AI-powered development platform. As a test I used it to create two projects: a basic CRM and a crypto tracker app.
The platform's community-driven templates are a highlight. I was able to remix pre-built templates to get a head start, which sped up prototyping significantly. Since any project created on the free tier becomes publicly accessible, there’s a growing library of examples to draw inspiration from.
One feature I particularly enjoyed was the ability to tweak individual components through focused prompts. For instance, I could select a single button and refine its functionality or style without needing to touch the rest of the app. This made the process feel less overwhelming and great for small adjustments.
I liked the native Supabase integration, which made configuring databases and authentication very simple. Setting up back-end services usually feels like a chore, but Lovable handled it with minimal input on my part.
While the free tier is helpful for experimenting, it’s too restrictive for serious use. The $20/month starter tier is much better and gave me enough prompts to complete my projects. That said, if you're not careful with your prompts, it’s easy to burn through your credits quickly. For one of my projects, I ended up using the daily free prompts to make minor fixes after exhausting my monthly quota.
Another where Lovable could improve is its deployment process. While functional, it doesn’t feel as streamlined as platforms like Bolt.new. Additionally, the lack of a built-in code editor can be frustrating if you want to make manual adjustments. I had to export my code to VS Code to tweak certain elements.
Overall, Lovable is a solid platform for quickly creating functional apps, especially for those who prioritize simplicity and speed over extensive customization. While it’s not perfect, I’m definitely curious to see how it continues to stack up against competitors like Bolt.new in the future.
28. Cursor
Cursor is a cutting-edge AI-powered code editor. The idea of having an AI assist with coding, debugging, and optimization felt like a huge leap forward, so I dove in with high expectations. After using it for a while, I can see why it's so popular, though it’s not without its shortcomings.
The first thing that stood out to me was how well Cursor handled routine coding tasks. While working on a React project, I asked it to generate functional components, and it delivered clean, efficient code that often included helpful performance tips. Its autocomplete feature felt natural and intuitive, often predicting my intentions before I even finished typing. It saved me a lot of time on repetitive tasks like boilerplate code creation and small adjustments.
I also put its debugging capabilities to the test by feeding it a Python script riddled with errors. Cursor not only pinpointed the issues but explained the solutions clearly and concisely. It felt like having a coding mentor on hand, walking me through my mistakes in a way that boosted my understanding. For newer developers or anyone brushing up on their coding skills, this feature could be incredibly valuable.
But as I started working on more complex projects, Cursor began to show its limitations. For example, when I tried using it to refactor a tangled mess of legacy JavaScript code, its suggestions didn’t consider the larger structure of my application. Implementing the changes caused other parts of the codebase to break, which made me question its ability to handle context in more intricate systems.
The Pro version of Cursor, priced at $25 per month, offers access to advanced AI models and priority updates. While the free version is sufficient for casual use, professionals may find themselves needing to upgrade to unlock its full potential. That said, compared to alternatives like GitHub Copilot, Cursor’s pricing feels a bit steep for what it offers.
Despite these issues, Cursor shines in certain scenarios. Its simplicity, speed, and smart suggestions make it an excellent choice for solo developers working on small to medium-sized projects. I found it particularly effective when prototyping ideas or making quick iterations. The clean interface and user-friendly design also make it a great option for beginners looking to learn and get comfortable with coding.
29. v0
PlayIntroducing v0: Generative UI
v0 is a tool designed for rapid prototyping and code generation. I found it to be a mix of convenience and limitations. While it’s undeniably helpful for getting projects off the ground quickly, it’s not without its quirks—especially for more complex or customized work.
What v0 does well is speed. I tried using it to build a basic UI for a React app with Tailwind, and I had a working layout within a few minutes. It’s intuitive and great for laying the foundation of a project. However, its output can feel restrictive if you stray from its default setups like Tailwind or shadcn. The further you deviate, the more time you’ll spend manually adjusting things to fit your vision, which can defeat the purpose of using it for speed.
To push its capabilities further, I tested v0 on a fun side project—a simple 2D game. It generated a playable prototype almost immediately, which was impressive. When I challenged it to turn the game into 3D, it wasn’t perfect, but it managed to create something workable after a few iterations. It felt like working with a junior developer: fast and capable for basic tasks, but needing guidance for anything more complex.
That said, v0 has some noticeable limitations. One issue I ran into was its lack of depth in explanations. When I asked it to clarify a specific code snippet, the responses were too surface-level to be truly helpful. If you’re looking for detailed insights or trying to learn from the code, v0 isn’t the best tool for that. It’s better suited for generating quick concepts rather than providing a deep understanding.
Another drawback is its struggle with edge cases. For example, when I tried to tweak a layout to fit a custom design, v0 couldn’t handle the adjustments without breaking other parts of the structure. Similarly, while it’s great at generating code, I often had to refine and clean up the output to make it more maintainable in the long run.
At $20 per month, v0’s pricing feels fair if you’re using it regularly for prototyping or small projects. But if your workflow doesn’t rely on tools like Tailwind or you’re already comfortable building things manually, it might not offer enough value to justify the subscription.
Despite its limitations, v0 shines when you need to get something up and running quickly. It’s excellent for getting 80% of the work done in a short amount of time, making it ideal for projects where you just need a functional starting point. It’s also a useful tool for learning or experimenting with ideas you wouldn’t have tackled from scratch.
The best AI project management tools
30. Asana
Asana is a comprehensive work management platform designed to help teams plan, track, and manage projects efficiently. It offers a range of tools for task management, project tracking, and team collaboration.
Asana has integrated a number of AI-powered features. One notable addition is the Smart Status feature, which provides quick updates on the status of projects and tasks.
Another of their AI tools is Smart Chat, an AI-powered assistant that delivers answers to project management questions. This feature has been particularly useful in my experience, as it offers immediate assistance with project-related queries, reducing the time spent searching for information. 
Additionally, Asana has introduced Smart Summaries, which automatically generate concise overviews of tasks and projects, helping teams quickly grasp key information. This feature is great for reviewing project progress and ensuring that all my team members are aligned and informed. 
All of these AI enhancements automate routine tasks and provide valuable insights, allowing me to focus more on the more strategic aspects of project management and less on the admin.
However, it's worth noting that while Asana offers a robust set of features, some key functionalities are gated behind higher-tier plans, which may be a consideration for teams with budget constraints.
Asana offers a free plan for up to 10 users with basic features. To access the AI features, you'll need the Starter Plan at $13.49 per user per month, which includes all basic features plus AI enhancements.
31. ClickUp
ClickUp is a comprehensive project management platform designed to enhance team collaboration.
Upon signing up, I was greeted with an intuitive interface that allowed me to create tasks, set deadlines, and assign responsibilities with ease. The platform offers various views—such as List, Board, and Calendar—that cater to different project management styles. I found the Board view particularly useful for visualizing task progress, similar to Kanban boards.
ClickUp lets me break down projects into subtasks, set priorities, and track time spent on each task. The real-time collaboration feature enabled my team members to comment on tasks, share files, and receive instant notifications about updates. It's all very elegant and calmed my OCD.
There's loads of nifty little automations you can do. A very simple example is that I set up an automation to move tasks to a "Completed" status once all subtasks were checked off. You can get way more complex that than, but it's a good example of how ClickUp's automation features can make everything flow more easily. The platform also integrates with various third-party tools like Slack, Google Drive, and GitHub, which keeps everything nice and neat.
ClickUp's AI capabilities assist in drafting project plans, generating meeting agendas, and summarizing documents. I used the AI to draft a project outline, and it provided a structured framework that I could further customize, which was a great help.
ClickUp is ideal for teams of all sizes seeking a comprehensive project management solution. Its flexibility makes it suitable for pretty much any project management use case. The platform's scalability ensures it can adapt to both small startups and large enterprises.
ClickUps offers a free plan that includes unlimited tasks, docs, and members, with 100MB storage. To access ClickUp's AI features, you'll need to subscribe to a paid plan with the cheapest being the Unlimited Plan at $10 per user per month.
The best AI scheduling assistants
32. Reclaim
PlayWhat is Reclaim.ai? Smart AI Scheduling for Google Calendar 🗓️✨
Reclaim is an AI-powered scheduling assistant that helps optimize your calendar by automatically managing tasks, meetings, and breaks according to your priorities. I started using Reclaim to manage my schedule more effectively, and it’s made a big difference in how I organize my time.
Once I linked Reclaim to my Google Calendar, I entered all my tasks and meetings, along with their respective priority levels. The AI then adjusted my calendar and automatically assigned time slots for each task. This took a lot of the mental load off my plate and made sure I wasn’t overlooking important commitments.
The tool identifies the best times for deep work and blocks those hours off to prevent meetings from taking over. This was especially helpful for making sure my most important tasks were tackled without interruptions.
Reclaim also helps with scheduling meetings. It automatically finds the best times that work for everyone, taking into account existing events and personal preferences. This made coordinating with my team much easier, saving time that would normally be spent going back and forth on availability.
However, there were a few areas where Reclaim could improve. The AI sometimes misinterpreted the priority of certain tasks, which led to less optimal scheduling decisions. Additionally, I found the customization options for categorizing tasks to be a bit limiting.
I found that Reclaim offered a more well-rounded approach by handling both tasks and meetings. Clockwise (more details below) excels at optimizing meeting times, but Reclaim's ability to manage a wider range of events made it more useful overall for my needs.
Reclaim offers a Lite Plan at no cost, providing essential smart time-blocking features. The Starter Plan costs $10 per user per month.
33. Clockwise
PlayClockwise AI Scheduler: Meet your new scheduling assistant
Clockwise is an AI-powered scheduling assistant designed to optimize your calendar by intelligently managing meetings and creating uninterrupted focus time. Since I began using Clockwise I've found it to be a valuable tool in organizing my workday.
After integrating Clockwise with my Google Calendar, I marked certain meetings as flexible. The AI then analyzed my schedule and automatically rescheduled these meetings to create longer blocks of focus time. This adjustment allowed me to dedicate uninterrupted periods to deep work, which had a noticeable impact on the amount of work I got done on a typical day.
Clockwise also facilitated easier meeting coordination. It automatically found the best times for meetings, considering all participants' availability and existing commitments. This feature streamlined the scheduling process, reducing the back-and-forth typically involved in finding suitable meeting times. 
However, I did encounter some limitations. Clockwise makes the same mistake that Relcaim does of occasionally misinterpreting the priority of certain tasks, leading to some wacky scheduling decisions.
In comparison to Reclaim, another AI scheduling assistant, Clockwise provided a more focused approach by optimizing meeting times and creating focus periods. While Reclaim offered a broader range of features, including task management.
Clockwise offers a Free Plan with access to intelligent calendar management features. Their paid plans start at $6.75 per month but you have to pay an annual bill.
The best AI tools for customer service
34. Tidio AI
PlayWhy Use Tidio? I Turn Your Website Visitors Into Customers
Tidio is a customer service platform that integrates AI-driven tools.
Tidio's main AI feature is the Lyro AI Chatbot, designed to handle up to 70% of customer inquiries. I implemented Lyro to manage common questions and tasks, allowing our human customer service agents to focus on complex issues.
The chatbot's natural language processing capabilities enabled it to understand and respond to customer queries effectively. For instance, when one of our customers inquired about product specifications, Lyro provided detailed information and resolved the customer's query successfully. This had a hugely positive impact on our response times and customer satisfaction scores.
Another valuable tool is the Reply Assistant, which leverages GPT-4 technology to transform basic responses into professional, contextually relevant messages. I loved this feature because it improves the quality of our support team's replies. By inputting a simple response, the AI suggested more polished and informative alternatives, ensuring consistent and high-quality communication. This also helped get the team's support for these new AI features as they saw how it was going to supplement their efforts, rather than replace them.
Tidio's Smart Views feature offers real-time insights into customer interactions, allowing support agents to prioritize and manage conversations effectively. The ability to see which customers are online and what pages they're viewing enabled proactive engagement, leading to quicker issue resolution.
The platform also provides comprehensive analytics and reporting tools. I used these to track the performance of AI features, such as response times and customer satisfaction ratings. The data revealed that Lyro handled a significant portion of inquiries, allowing human agents to address more complex cases.
Tidio offers a 7-day free trial. Their starter plan at $29/month gives you 50 Lyro AI conversations.
35. Hiver
Hiver is an AI-powered customer service platform designed to help teams manage shared inboxes like support and sales emails. I started using Hiver to streamline our team’s email management and improve our customer service response times. The integration with Gmail made it very easy to adopt.
One feature I found particularly useful was the AI Summarizer. With a lot of email threads piling up, it can be time-consuming to read through long chains of emails to get to the key points. The AI Summarizer condenses these conversations into quick, digestible summaries, highlighting the most important details like decisions, tasks, and follow-ups. This feature helped me stay on top of conversations without getting bogged down by lengthy threads. It’s a huge time-saver, especially when handling multiple customer inquiries simultaneously.
Another tool I appreciated was the AI Bot – Harvey, which automatically filters out redundant or low-priority emails, such as auto-replies or basic queries that don’t require much attention. It helped keep our inbox cleaner and allowed me and my colleagues to focus on the more complex requests. We saw a noticeable reduction in our average query handling time because of this feature.
The Analytics and Reporting tools were another highlight for me. I was able to easily track our performance with metrics like response times, customer satisfaction ratings, and the volume of tickets handled by the AI bot. This insight was valuable for identifying areas where we could improve and optimizing how we allocate tasks between the AI and our human team members.
That said, while Hiver is a powerful tool, I did find that there were times when the AI Summarizer missed some nuances in long email threads, requiring a manual review. Additionally, while Harvey was great at filtering out simpler inquiries, it occasionally flagged some queries as redundant that actually required attention, which led to some minor delays.
I loved this platform, but I still see room for more flexibility in customizing the AI’s decision-making process, especially when it comes to complex inquiries. Overall, Hiver has been incredibly helpful in improving how we manage customer support emails. It saved me time by automating repetitive tasks and helped our team focus on delivering better, more personalized support.
Hiver’s Free Plan includes 1 shared inbox and basic features like live chat and knowledge base. The Lite Plan at $24 per user/month adds 2 shared inboxes, light automation, analytics, and integrations.
The best AI tools for recruitment
36.Textio
Textio is an AI-powered platform designed to enhance the quality and inclusivity of recruitment communications, particularly job postings. I began using Textio to improve some job descriptions for open positions we have on our team and found it to be a valuable tool in attracting a diverse pool of candidates.
I found particularly useful was the Textio Score, which evaluates the effectiveness of the language used in job postings. It provides a numerical score indicating how likely the posting is to attract diverse applicants. The score is based on a number of factors and by adjusting the language based on Textio's suggestions, I was able to improve the score, leading to a more inclusive and appealing job description. 
While some tools offer features like resume screening or candidate matching, Textio's emphasis on crafting effective and unbiased job postings provides a unique advantage in attracting a diverse talent pool.
Textio offers a 14-day free trial for users to explore its platform.
37.CVViZ
CVViZ is an AI-powered recruitment platform designed to streamline the hiring process by automating tasks such as job posting, resume screening, and candidate engagement. I found it to be a valuable tool in attracting and selecting qualified candidates.

The best AI knowledge management tools
38.Notion AI Q&A
PlayIntroducing the new Notion AI
Notion AI Q&A is a powerful tool that allows users to access a company's knowledge base across thousands of Notion pages. I first started using it in my new job, and it quickly became one of my favorite AI tools.
As an introvert, having the ability to ask any question (without bothering anyone) and instantly receive a detailed, accurate answer—powered by the collective knowledge stored across the company's Notion workspace—was incredibly empowering. It felt like having a personal assistant who could provide information from all corners of the company at any time.
Notion AI Q&A is especially valuable compared to tools like Google Drive search. It doesn’t just give you links to documents but actually provides relevant answers pulled directly from the content, making it much quicker to get to the heart of a question. This saved me countless hours when I needed quick answers to detailed inquiries.
However, while the desktop experience is smooth, I’ve faced some frustrating issues on Android, particularly with my Pixel 8 running Android 14. The app tends to freeze, lag, or glitch quite a bit, making it difficult to rely on it when I’m on the go. Or I could just buy an iPhone I suppose.
One other negative is the pricing. Notion AI is priced as an add-on feature, costing $10 per member each month ($8 when paying annual), which is quite reasonable given the benefits, but can add up pretty quickly if you are a big team. I still think it's worth it though.
For companies with large internal knowledge bases, I think Notion AI Q&A is an essential tool for simplifying information retrieval and making knowledge accessible to everyone, regardless of their role or level of expertise.
39.Guru
PlayGuru Overview: All-in-One Knowledge Management–Enterprise Search, Intranet, and Wiki/Knowledge Base
Guru is an AI-powered knowledge management platform designed to centralize and streamline access to company information. In my experience, integrating Guru into our workflow significantly enhanced our team's efficiency and collaboration. Guru integrates with Slack, Teams, Salesforce, and pretty much every other platform you can think of.
Upon implementation, Guru allowed us to access verified knowledge directly within our communication channels, reducing the need to switch between platforms. The AI-powered search functionality was particularly impressive, delivering relevant information based on context, history, role, and location. 
Guru's AI Training Center, enabled us to review and improve AI-generated answers, ensuring accuracy and relevance.
The platform's verification system ensured that the information we accessed was up-to-date and reliable. Automated reminders prompted subject matter experts to keep content fresh, fostering a culture of continuous improvement. 
Guru is ideal for teams seeking a comprehensive knowledge management solution that integrates seamlessly with existing workflows. The downside is that it's a bit pricey at $15/user/month - almost double what Notion AI costs.

40.HubSpot AI Email Writer
PlayHow to use AI to Write an Email with HubSpot
HubSpot offers an AI-powered email assistant designed to kickstart your creative juices and help write up personalized emails at scale. The platform’s AI assistant generates copy fit for various email campaigns, like sales outreach, marketing newsletters, and so on. 
You can then edit or repurpose generated drafts by automatically changing their tones as well as lengthening or shortening them. HubSpot also includes a drag-and-drop email template builder with numerous customizable use-case-specific presets, perfect for further streamlining creative processes. 
What I found most useful is that HubSpot’s AI email writer links with the platform’s CRM database. That means you can roll out email campaigns and automatically log conversations to your contact lists. From there, you can track progress and send out follow-ups at the right time to maximize response rates. Plus, you can use the platform’s AI assistant directly from your Gmail account, which spares you the need to juggle between multiple tabs.

The email writing assistant is available for free, while more advanced email functionalities are available throughout HubSpot’s Marketing Hub paid packages. Pricing starts at $15 per month.
41.SaneBox
PlayGet rid of Inbox clutter with SaneBox
SaneBox is an AI-driven email management tool designed to help users declutter their inboxes by intelligently sorting incoming emails.
Setting up Sanebox involved connecting it to my Gmail account, and then the service began analyzing my email habits to categorize incoming messages. It created folders such as SaneLater for less urgent emails and SaneBlackHole for unwanted senders. This initial configuration required minimal effort and was completed within minutes. 
SaneBox's AI effectively filtered emails based on my past interactions. Important messages from frequent contacts appeared in my main inbox, while newsletters and promotional emails were directed to the SaneLater folder.
Beyond sorting, SaneBox offers features like snoozing emails and setting reminders for follow-ups. The snooze function allowed me to temporarily remove non-urgent emails from my inbox and have them return at a more convenient time. The reminder feature ensured I followed up on important emails, preventing tasks from slipping through the cracks. 
While SaneBox significantly improved my email organization, there were a few drawbacks. The service occasionally misclassified emails, directing important messages to the SaneLater folder. Additionally, I can imagine that the daily digest of filtered emails could be overwhelming, especially during periods of high email volume.
Overall, SaneBox offers a comprehensive suite of features that go beyond basic filtering. Its AI-driven approach to email sorting and additional functionalities like snoozing and reminders make managing your inbox more efficient and less stressful.
SaneBox offers a 14-day free trial. After the trial, the Snack Plan at $7 per month provides access to two features on a single email account.
42.Shortwave
PlayMeet your AI email assistant
Shortwave is an AI-powered email client with features such as AI email summarization, language translation, and task management.
After connecting it to my Gmail account, the application began analyzing my email history to provide personalized AI assistance.
Shortwave main feature is AI email summarization. The AI assistant provided concise summaries of lengthy email threads, enabling me to grasp key points without reading through extensive conversations. I don't really handle that many emails in my job, but I can imagine it would be particularly beneficial for someone in a sales or outreach role where it would do a lot to reduce the cognitive load of reading and processing so many conversations.
Shortwave's language translation feature translated emails accurately, preserving the context and tone of the original message. The tool also has some handy functional that lets me convert emails into tasks, set reminders, and track progress without leaving the application.
While I was impressed with Shortwave, the AI assistant occasionally misinterpreted the context of certain emails, leading to less accurate summaries or translations. Nevertheless, it's a comprehensive suite of features (AI summarization, translation, and task management) within a single platform.
Shortwave offers a free plan which includes basic email management features like AI assistance, 90 days of searchable email history, and inbox customization. Their personal plan costs $8.50 per seat/month.
The best AI presentation makers
43.Gamma
PlayGamma: AI for presenting ideas, beautifully
Gamma is an AI-powered presentation tool that has made creating professional slides much easier.
I gave it a try and I was impressed by how quickly it generated clean, visually appealing slides from simple prompts. What stood out immediately was the design quality. The AI handled the layout and formatting, allowing me to focus more on the content itself. I didn’t need to worry about alignment, colors, or fonts—Gamma took care of all of that.
While the design of the slides looks great, I did find some limitations in the editing features. Gamma’s customization options, especially when it comes to modifying layouts and slide elements, felt somewhat restrictive. For example, while I could adjust text and add media, fine-tuning certain parts of the design (like moving text boxes or resizing elements) wasn’t as easy as I would have liked. I also noticed that the templates, though beautiful, are somewhat limiting if you want to move away from their general style or structure.
Despite these limitations, it's a great choice for users who need to put together polished presentations without spending hours on design details.
The Free Plan offers 400 AI credits, basic image generation, and the ability to create up to 10 slides per presentation. The Plus Plan at $10/user/month includes unlimited AI creation, advanced image tools, more slides, and priority support.
44.Presentations.ai
PlayCreating stunning Presentations and Slides using AI
Presentations.ai is another AI-powered platform designed to simplify the creation of professional presentations.
I would say that I found the visual appeal of the slides generated by this tool are pretty comparable with the slides generated by Gamma - there's not much in it.
Both tools also have real time collaboration features, enabling multiple users to work on the same presentation simultaneously.
One advantage that I found with Presentations.ai is that it aligned the generated presentation with my corporate brand and theme more closely than Gamma did. The slides that Gamma generated probably needed a bit more tinkering in this regard.
Presentations.ai currently offers a Starter Plan for free (limited-time Early Bird pricing) with features like limited AI credits, team collaboration, basic functionality, and seamless sharing. For more advanced needs, the Pro Plan is available at $198 per user per year, providing additional AI credits, pro templates, custom fonts and colors, analytics, and PDF export.
The best AI resume builders
45.Teal
PlayTeal Home & Main Dashboard
Teal is an AI-powered resume builder that helps me refine and optimize my resume. As someone who’s worked on my resume multiple times, I’ve always found it a bit tedious to get everything right, especially with the constant need to tailor it for specific job applications. I was curious to see how Teal could help speed up the process while ensuring my resume stood out.
I added my job history, skills, and career goals and I was shown a live preview of the resume and Teal generated relevant bullet points based on my experience. For example, when I entered my previous role in marketing, the AI suggested action-oriented phrases like "increased engagement by 30%" or "managed a team of 5," which gave my resume a polished, results-oriented feel right from the start. It saved me a lot of time and brainpower, as I didn’t have to come up with the right words or phrasing.
Teal lets you import a job description, and it then tailors your resume by suggesting key skills and experience you might want to highlight. I tested this by uploading a marketing manager role I was interested in, and Teal highlighted key phrases from the job description and suggested how to incorporate them into my resume. It felt like a great way to ensure my resume was tailored for the position I was applying for without much extra work.
Teal also provided real-time feedback on my resume. It gave suggestions like "add more measurable achievements" or "use more action verbs," which I found really helpful. These suggestions made it clear where I could improve my resume, even if the content was technically correct. For example, I had some bullet points that didn’t really show the impact of my work, and Teal helped me reframe those to highlight results more effectively.
There are a couple of things that could be better. The AI, while quite helpful, wasn’t perfect. A few of the suggested phrases felt too generic and didn’t fully capture the nuances of my role. I had to tweak some of them to better reflect my personal contributions. Additionally, while there are a lot of customization options, I felt that some of the design templates were a bit too limited for my taste. I’d love to have more flexibility with fonts or section layouts to match my personal style.
Teal offers a Free Plan that includes unlimited resumes and job tracking. The Teal+ Plan is available for $29 per month and gives you unlimited access to all the other features.
46.Kickresume
PlayIt's time for your best resume yet | Kickresume
Kickresume is an AI-powered resume builder designed to assist users in creating professional and tailored resumes efficiently. The platform offers various templates and design options.
Kickresume's AI-driven content suggestions are super helpful. After I added the job title and job description/responsibilities, the AI proposed relevant bullet points and achievements. One of the most time-consuming aspects of applying for jobs is customizing your resume for the specific role, which typically involves highlighting a specific achievement or project that you have worked on. By analyzing the job description, Kickresume suggests relevant skills and experiences to include, enhancing the resume's alignment with the desired position. I found the AI suggestions were almost always helpful.
Kickresume also provides real-time feedback on the content and formatting of the resume. The platform highlights areas that may require improvement, such as keyword optimization and alignment with job descriptions.
Kickresume offers a Free Plan with basic resume and cover letter templates, a personal website template, and access to 20,000 pre-written phrases. For more features, the Monthly Plan at $19/month includes premium templates, unlimited customization, an AI resume checker, and priority support.
The best AI voice generators
47.ElevenLabs
PlayElevenLabs - Text to Speech, Dubbing, Sound Effects and more
ElevenLabs is widely seen as the leading AI voice generator. It offers text-to-speech and voice cloning capabilities.
The voice quality is very high. I tested it by converting some text into speech, and the AI-generated voice sounded incredibly natural. It captured human intonation and rhythm much more effectively than I expected. I could also adjust parameters like pitch, speed, and tone, which gave me more control over how the voice would sound.
I uploaded a sample of my own voice to the voice cloning feature, and it generated a model that closely resembled my speech patterns. I tested it by inputting my own text, and it sounded almost identical to my original recording. I did notice some slight differences in tone at times, but it was still incredibly accurate.
I also tried integrating ElevenLabs with a text-to-speech application, which allowed me to seamlessly convert written content into spoken words. This is particularly useful for accessibility purposes or for anyone who prefers consuming content in audio format.
While ElevenLabs does offer impressive features, there are a few areas for improvement. The AI-generated voices sometimes require minor adjustments for more precise tonal nuances. The customization options, though extensive, can feel a bit restrictive for more specific needs or highly specialized voices.
I should also mention ElevenLabs AI Dubbing Studio, which really impressed me with its ability to create voiceovers and dub content in multiple languages. I uploaded a video and was able to quickly generate high-quality voiceover tracks in different voices and accents. It's a bit pricey, and there's no video dubbing/lip-sync capabilities (for that, check out Synthesia's AI video dubbing), but otherwise I thought it was a pretty neat extra set of features and it's definitely one of my favourite video translation apps.
ElevenLabs offers a free plan that gives you 10k credits (10 mins of text-to-speech). Their Starter Plan costs $5/month and gives you 30k credits (30 mins) along with voice cloning and Dubbing Studio access.
48.Murf
PlayAll-New Murf AI 
I recently started using Murf AI for generating voiceovers for a few content creation projects. Specifically, I needed to produce voiceovers for explainer videos I was working on. The goal was to save time while still achieving high-quality, professional-sounding audio without having to record everything manually.
I created an account and uploaded a script for my first video. I was able to choose from a wide selection of voices, including male and female options, in various accents and languages. The user interface is intuitive, and I found myself able to jump straight into the process without needing a tutorial.
One of the things I loved was how realistic the voices sounded. I tested several options and was impressed with how well the AI mimicked natural speech patterns. The intonation and rhythm were particularly good for a text-to-speech system. I used the voice that best matched the tone of the video, and it gave me a finished product that sounded professional and clear. It felt like a voiceover artist had recorded it, without the need for studio time (and $).
Murf allows you to adjust parameters like pitch, speed, and tone. This was a huge help in fine-tuning the delivery of the lines. For example, I wanted a slightly more upbeat tone for the intro of the video, and Murf allowed me to make these adjustments easily.
Another feature I tried was the voice cloning tool, which allows you to create a replica of your own voice. I uploaded a short sample of my voice to test this, and the system generated a voice model that was surprisingly accurate. This feature could be useful for personalizing voiceovers, particularly if you want your own voice to appear in various content without having to record it each time.
While I was generally impressed, I did encounter a couple of limitations. For instance, when I tested the AI-generated voice for more complex sentences, there were occasional mispronunciations or unnatural pauses. In these cases, I found it helpful to manually tweak the text or use Murf’s editing features to smooth things over. It would be ideal if the system could handle these nuances automatically, but it’s still a very solid tool overall.
For my particular project, Murf saved me a ton of time. Instead of recording my own voice for every line, I could focus more on the creative aspects of my video and use Murf to handle the bulk of the audio. I also found it useful when I needed to quickly create multiple versions of the same script—adjusting for different audiences or purposes without re-recording the entire voiceover.
Murf offers a Free Plan with 10 minutes of voice generation and transcription, access to 120+ voices, and basic audio/video sharing. The Creator Plan at $29/month includes unlimited downloads, access to 200+ voices, 2 hours of voice generation per month, and commercial usage rights.
The best AI music generators
49.Suno
PlaySuno iOS App is Here! Make any song you can imagine
Suno is an AI-powered music generator that allows users to create songs by inputting text prompts. I entered a prompt describing the mood and genre I desired—a melancholic piano ballad—and Suno produced a complete song with vocals and instrumentation. The AI's ability to interpret and translate textual descriptions into musical compositions is pretty mind blowing.
I found my generated song to be surprisingly coherent and emotive. The vocals, while synthetic, conveyed the intended melancholy, and the piano arrangement complemented the mood effectively. However, there were moments where the lyrics felt slightly repetitive, and the vocal delivery lacked some human nuances.
Suno offers limited editing capabilities. I attempted to adjust the tempo and key, but the options were somewhat constrained. For more intricate modifications, external audio editing software would be necessary.
Despite the editing limitations, I found the experience enjoyable and plan to use Suno again for generating quick musical ideas or exploring different genres. My most frequent use case for Suno is background music for social media posts and videos, and it's really great for that.
AI-generated music is gaining traction, with platforms like Suno making it accessible to a broader audience. But while AI can produce impressive compositions, it currently lacks the depth and emotional complexity of human-created music. I think it will be a while yet until we're listening to AI-generated music for pleasure.
Suno offers a Free Plan with 50 daily credits for up to 10 song generations per day, suitable for personal and non-commercial use. The Pro Plan at $10/month provides 2,500 credits per month, commercial use rights, priority generation, and the ability to run up to 10 tasks simultaneously.
Be sure to get the Pro Plan if you want to use Suno like I do for social media posts and videos, as you'll need the commercial license.
50. Udio
PlayUdio: Make your music
To test Udio, I wanted to create an upbeat, electronic track with a strong bassline and catchy melodies, so I fed it a prompt describing the vibe I was aiming for.
The track had a solid structure, with a clear intro, build-up, and drop. The synths were vibrant and energetic, and the rhythm section had a groove that made the track feel engaging.
One thing that sets Udio apart from Suno is its approach to genre-specific customization. Udio offers a more direct way of shaping the style of the music based on the prompt you give it. For example, I could request specific instruments or even ask for a particular type of electronic subgenre. While the song was definitely listenable and had the vibe I wanted, it wasn’t without limitations. The vocals, while fitting, still felt a bit robotic.
Editing options in Udio are also a bit more flexible than Suno, but still not at the level of traditional music production software.
Udio offers a Free Plan with 100 credits per month for up to 50 song generations and basic music creation tools. For more credits you'll need the Standard Plan which costs $10/month.
The best AI marketing tools
51. Ad Creative
PlayGenerate Engaging Ad Creatives with AdCreative.ai | Official Promo Video
AdCreative is an AI-powered platform that simplifies the process of creating ad creatives for platforms like Facebook, Instagram, and Google Ads. After spending some time using it, I found it to be a convenient tool that saves time and delivers professional results, though it does have some limitations depending on your goals.
AdCreative is super easy to use. I entered details about my campaign—like the product and target audience—and the tool generated several polished ad designs tailored to different platforms. The designs followed current advertising trends, making them ready to use with only minor adjustments. For someone like me without a design background this tool really opens up a lot of ad options.
I could easily tweak the text, replace images, and add my logo to align the ads with my branding. The interface is intuitive and beginner-friendly, so even with limited design experience, I felt confident editing the outputs.
One feature that stood out was the ability to generate multiple ad variations for A/B testing. AdCreative made it simple to produce different versions of an ad with variations in headlines or visuals. This was a huge time-saver and perfect for campaigns that require constant testing and optimization.
There are some drawbacks. When working with niche products, I noticed the designs sometimes lacked creativity and felt a bit generic. While the tool is great for creating clean, professional-looking ads, it struggles to bring a unique or artistic flair to campaigns that require a more distinctive touch. This may not be an issue for standard e-commerce products, but it’s a limitation for brands looking to stand out with highly original concepts.
Another area where the tool fell short was copywriting. While it provides suggestions for ad headlines and descriptions, the text often felt formulaic and uninspired. I frequently had to rewrite the copy or ask ChatGPT to offer some ideas that better match my brand’s tone and messaging.
AdCreative’s pricing is reasonable for frequent users, starting at $39/month, which is far more affordable than hiring a designer. However, for occasional users, the cost may feel less justified, especially if the outputs require significant manual adjustments.

52. Clay
PlayWhat is Clay?
Clay is a powerful lead generation platform that simplifies prospecting by automating data collection, enrichment, and scoring. After testing it across multiple campaigns, I found it to be a valuable tool for advanced users, though it comes with a learning curve and isn’t a perfect fit for everyone.
If you’re unsure what Clay does, think of it as a powerful mega-spreadsheet that seamlessly integrates with hundreds of data sources. It allows you to organize all your prospects' information, their details, and the emails you plan to send—all in one place.
To test the platform I tried creating a prospect list by defining parameters like job titles and company size. Clay saved me hours of manual research by returning an enriched dataset with detailed insights. Its lead scoring feature was helpful, enabling me to prioritize high-value leads based on how well they aligned with my campaign objectives.
Be warned, the setup process can be intimidating for less tech-savvy users, and it took me some time to fully grasp how to make the most of its features. The platform can be tricky to navigate, and without proper knowledge, you risk wasting your credits—and by extension, your money.
For those interested, Clay offers a free version for small-scale testing. Its paid plans range from $149 to $800 per month, with higher-tier options providing better savings on credit costs for heavy users.
